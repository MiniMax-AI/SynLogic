# SynLogic

This repository contains the code and data for SynLogic, a comprehensive logical reasoning data synthesis framework that generates diverse, verifiable reasoning data at scale. Our work addresses the critical gap in high-quality logical reasoning training data for developing general reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs).

## News
- :fire: [05/2025] We are excited to release the resources for the paper "SynLogic: Synthesizing Verifiable Reasoning Data at Scale for Learning Logical Reasoning and Beyond"

## üìã Overview

**SynLogic** is a data synthesis framework and comprehensive dataset that:
- üìä **Covers 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks** including Sudoku, Game of 24, Cipher, Arrow Maze, and more
- üéØ **Enables controllable difficulty synthesis** with adjustable parameters for each task
- ‚úÖ **Provides verifiable rewards** through rule-based verification for RL training
- üöÄ **Achieves SOTA performance** among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by 6 points on BBEH

### Key Features
- **Scalable Data Generation**: Unlimited synthesis with controllable difficulty levels
- **Comprehensive Task Coverage**: 35 distinct logical reasoning tasks with custom generators and verifiers
- **RL-Ready**: All examples can be verified by simple rules, making them ideal for reinforcement learning
- **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Strong generalization to mathematical and coding domains

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/SynLogic.git
cd SynLogic
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate Sample Data (Arrow Maze Example)
```bash
# Quick example with Arrow Maze
bash games/tasks/arrow_maze/run.sh

# Or with custom parameters
python scripts/arrow_maze.py \
  --num_of_data 1000 \
  --width 5 \
  --height 5 \
  --arrow_fill_rate_min 0.3 \
  --arrow_fill_rate_max 0.9
```
